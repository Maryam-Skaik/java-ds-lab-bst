# ✅ Assignment Solutions – Binary Search Trees (BST) Module

This folder contains **model solutions** for BST assignments
in the Java DS Lab.

📌 Solutions are released **after the semester** for revision and self-study.

---

## 📚 Problems Covered

1️⃣ Convert a BST to a sorted Singly Linked List (SLL)  
2️⃣ Calculate sum of node values at each level in BST  
3️⃣ Check if a preorder array represents a valid BST  
4️⃣ Merge two BSTs into a single balanced BST

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand **in-order traversal** for BST operations
- Convert BST structures into linked lists or arrays
- Validate BST properties (preorder, structure)
- Merge BSTs efficiently while maintaining balance
- Apply **recursion and iterative stack approaches**

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- All problems use **recursive approaches** where required
- Edge cases to test:
  - Empty BST
  - Single-node BST
  - Skewed (left/right-heavy) BSTs
- Comments in code explain step-by-step logic
